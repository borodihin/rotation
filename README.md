# Rotation
This monitor rotation stand is inspired by Istructables <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Motorized-Sit-or-Stand-Landscape-or-Portrait-Monit/">project</a> and based on <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>, <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">Autohotkey</a> and NoÃ«l Danjou <a href="http://noeld.com/programs.asp?cat=misc#Display">Display</a> programm.

Monitor stand is produced from 12 mm plywood:

The display on this stand is rotated by <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/DC-12V-30RPM-High-torque-Turbo-Encoder-Motor-Worm-Geared-Motor-Reducer-Motor-GM4632-370/32891279814.html">GM4632-370</a> DC 12V Geared-Motor, which in it's turn driving 1:5 plywood gear reductor with 10- and 50-teeth gears as you can see on the picture above (I use only 144&deg; sector of 50-teeth gear). By the way, you can visit Matthias Wandel <a href="http://www.woodgears.ca/">site</a> where you can find many interesting videos and power tool to draw such gears.

Used motor has a Hall encoder, so I can count turns to place display correctly in wide- and tall-position. The motor pinout is on scheme placed below:

The motor is powered from L298N H-bridge driven by Arduino Nano as you can see on scheme below:

There are two power jacks on this scheme because I have another DC 12V monitor placed near the stand and powered from this stand by the small cable.

All electronics placed in the small box formed on the stand base. For computer communication, the Arduino serial port is used. So there is a small 4-ports USB-hub in this project. Three ports are on its top and one is on the small side, placed under the top cover it is invisible:

So I desolder USB connectors from USB-hub and Arduino and use small wires to connect PCBs directly. In result, I have fully functional  USB-ports and full-time connected Arduino. By the way, there is an option to power this hub from the same DC 12V adapter using step down converter.

Electronics active cooling provided by small DC 12V fan powered from the second channel of L298N. Temperature is controlled by DS18B20 OneWire sensor.

There ate two endstop switchers placed on the top of the stand that used to stop motor to prevent mechanics damages. These pressed by the main big 50-tooth gear in its end positions.

When power is on first of all the display is rotated to its end position witch defined by the endstop switch pressed (power may be turned off directly on monitor rotating process and the display position is not clearly known) and then placed on the right wide-position. After that, I can turn the display to wide- or tall-position with binding Autohotkey keys (Win-F6 in the code) and sending command to Arduino using serial port:<br><code>RunWait, %ComSpec% /c echo o > COM3</code>,<br>where COM3 is my Arduino serial port. Same time I use Display program to change virtually display orientation and other connected displays positions:<br><code>RunWait, %ComSpec% /c "display.exe /device 1 /rotate 270 && display.exe /device 2 /position 1080 1472"</code>.

May be I will write some comprehensive code to synchronize Arduino and Autohotkey physical and virtual orientation, but now I can do in manually by pressing Alt-Win-F6 to place display virtual orientation to wide-position.
