# Rotation
This monitor rotation stand is inspired by Istructables <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Motorized-Sit-or-Stand-Landscape-or-Portrait-Monit/">project</a> and based on <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>, <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">Autohotkey</a> and NoÃ«l Danjou <a href="http://noeld.com/programs.asp?cat=misc#Display">Display</a> programm.

Monitor stand is produced from 12 mm plywood:

The display on this stand is rotated by <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/DC-12V-30RPM-High-torque-Turbo-Encoder-Motor-Worm-Geared-Motor-Reducer-Motor-GM4632-370/32891279814.html">GM4632-370</a> DC 12V Geared-Motor, which in it's turn drive 1:5 plywood gear reductor as you can see on the picture above. By the way, you can visit Matthias Wandel <a href="http://www.woodgears.ca/">site</a> where you can find many interesting videos and power tool to draw such gears.

The motor is powered from L298N H-bridge driven by Arduino Nano as you can see on scheme below:

There are two power jacks on this scheme because I have another DC 12V monitor placed near the stand.
