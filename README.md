# Rotation
This monitor rotation stand is inspired by Istructables <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Motorized-Sit-or-Stand-Landscape-or-Portrait-Monit/">project</a> and based on <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>, <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">Autohotkey</a> and NoÃ«l Danjou <a href="http://noeld.com/programs.asp?cat=misc#Display">Display</a> programm.

Monitor stand is produced from 12 mm plywood:

The display on this stand is rotated by <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/DC-12V-30RPM-High-torque-Turbo-Encoder-Motor-Worm-Geared-Motor-Reducer-Motor-GM4632-370/32891279814.html">GM4632-370</a> DC 12V Geared-Motor, which in it's turn driving 1:5 plywood gear reductor with 10- and 50-teeth gears as you can see on the picture above (I use only 144&deg; sector of 50-teeth gear). By the way, you can visit Matthias Wandel <a href="http://www.woodgears.ca/">site</a> where you can find many interesting videos and power tool to draw such gears.

Used motor has a Hall encoder, so I can count turns to place display correctly in wide- and tall-position. The motor pinout is on scheme placed below:

The motor is powered from L298N H-bridge driven by Arduino Nano as you can see on scheme below:

There are two power jacks on this scheme because I have another DC 12V monitor placed near the stand and power from this stabd bay the small cable.

All elecronics placed in small box formed on the stand base. For computer communication Arduino serial port is used. So there is a small 4-ports USB-hub in this project. 3 ports are on it's top and 4-th is on the small side, placed under the top cover it is invisible:

So I desolder USB connectors from USB-hub and Arduino and use small wires to connect PCBs directly. In result I have fully functional  USB-ports and COM-port.

Electronics active cooling provided by small DC 12V fan powered from second channel of L298N. Temperature is controlled by DS18B20 OneWire sensor.

There ate two endstop switchers placed on the top of stand that used to stop motor to prevent mecanics damages. These pressed by the main big 50-tooth gear in its end positions.

When power is on first of all the display is rotated to it's end position wich defined by the endstop switch pressed (power may turned off directly on monitor rotating process and display position is not clearly known) and then placed on the right wide-position. After that I can turn display to wide- or tall-position with binding Autohotkey keys (Win-F6 in the code). Same time I use Display programm to change virtually display orientation and othe connected displays positions.

May be I will write some comprehensive code to synchronize Arduino and Autohotkey physical and virtual orientation, but now I can do in manualy by pressing Alt-Win-F6 to place display virtual orientation to wide-position.
